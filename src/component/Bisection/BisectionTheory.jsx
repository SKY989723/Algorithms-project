            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                The bisection method is a numerical technique used to find the root of a real-valued function. It works on the principle of repeatedly dividing an interval in half and then selecting the subinterval where the root lies.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                Select an interval [a, b] where the function f(x) changes sign. This means f(a)â‹…f(b) less than 0, indicating that the root lies between a and b.
